# Term paper EC7415 
This repository contains data and MATLAB codes for my term paper from the course EC7415 Econometrics 4b: Empirical Macroeconomics. 

In this term paper, I investigated the role of macroeconomic uncertainty in Canadian unemployment dynamics using a smooth-transitioning VAR (STVAR). The term paper can be accessed from [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/fv7qowswm9hh4ux/Term_paper_EC7415_LM.pdf?dl=0).
 
Part of the analysis requires the MATLAB toolbox "macrometrics" written by Gabriel ZÃ¼llig. This toolbox can be download from here: https://gabrielzuellig.ch/macrometrics/
